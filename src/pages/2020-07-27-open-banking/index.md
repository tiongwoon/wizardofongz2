## A Brief History

It all started in the year 2015, when the revised version of the Payment Services Directives (PSD2) was released by the European Parliament as an initiative to encourage innovation in financial services, integrate the payments market and offer better consumer protection in the payments realm. This spurred the movement to allow for more transparency and flexibility in handling customers’ financial data. A year later, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the United Kingdom initiated the open banking rule for the nine biggest UK banks. In 2018, it came into force in the UK and had since led the open banking revolution across the world.

## What is Open Banking

### Without open banking

When we open an account at any bank, our data (transactions, bill payments, account details etc) is kept silo in the servers of that particular bank. The bank has full control and visibility of our data and no one else apart from the account holder can access the information. If the server is a garden, this garden is completely locked without a gate for any third party to enter.

### With open banking

Open banking rules that banks are required to build a gate into the garden for third parties such as fintech startups to access the information of the account holder. This means that you can now allow permission for authorized third parties to access your financial data in order to offer you financial services and products. The key to enter the analogical garden gate is API or Application Programming Interface, which you can read a crisp explanation of it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/628y0c/eli5_what_is_an_api/).

### Impact

With access to your financial data such as transactions and bill payments, startups, businesses, and innovators can now build services and products on top of it.
If you have accounts opened at multiple banks, you probably felt before the pain of having to access them through separate applications as the data is kept silo in separate gardens. With open banking, one can build a platform which integrates all the bank accounts and allow users to view them on a single dashboard interface. As an example, check out [Yolt](https://www.yolt.com/), a financial management app using open banking.

Furthermore, open banking can also be game-changing in the lending industry. For some, getting loans still require an arduous process with procedures including photocopying bank statements, identification documents, and visiting a brick and mortar store. With open banking, consumers can save the hassle and provide consent to lenders to view their transactions instantly, hence improving customer experience. On the other hand, [lenders can improve their businesses by speeding up credit assessment and decision through access to instant information](https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/18679/3-reasons-why-lending-companies-should-use-open-banking#:~:text=Open%20banking%20presents%20lenders%20with,credit%20decision%20in%20no%20time). Since the financial data obtained comes in standardised digital format, lenders can also run data analytics on it and hence improve the precision of the credit assessment. 

Recognising the potential large-scale impact of open banking, mammoth sums of money have been poured towards open banking providers. Earlier this year, Visa acquired San Francisco-based [Plaid](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANGAWayfXvh1oZ-OehucmQF3ecHu8vFxTK1qYfNBd_qq4QBHRH0-57Gm4RGnkiIyAI-tNtEOfqzrPqlY6sgjBoisX5mwNW7h_UaLdOxBpleVWQQ6Pg7_yYkB8COJXqqESHAYES7pCewFybBxDPBb4_a9tprm4lFePv_OgVa1tsQt) for 5.3billion USD whereas Europe-based [Tink](https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/01/stockholm-based-tink-secures-e90-million-to-help-banks-and-fintechs-leverage-open-banking/) secured a 90million EUR investment round. Here is a list of leading UK companies providing open banking services to banks and financial institutions. 

## Open Banking in Malaysia

In January 2019, the central bank, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), released a [guideline documentation](https://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=57&pg=137&ac=773&bb=file) for banks to standardise their data format. (BTW, open banking just will not work if each bank has its own data format. Imagine the pain of a third party having to work with tens or hundreds of different data formats(!) Hence why a standard protocol and format is necessary.) Have a look at the official repository [here](https://github.com/BankNegaraMY) if you are interested to see some examples of data format. There is also [Strings Global Sdn Bhd](https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/banking-malaysia-ripe-open-banking), a startup providing open banking services to local banks. All signs point to the budding rise of open banking in Malaysia in the coming decade.

## Conclusion

So, as we can see, open banking enables our financial data to break out of the enclosed servers of the banks and allows it to be shared with third parties which in turn provide value by building services and products on top of the data. This also means greater transparency and flexibility while opening the playing field for innovators. However, it is not all sunshine and rainbows. Making your data accessible to multiple parties increases the surface area for cyber attacks. Hence, security and data integrity need to be heavily prioritised. With Malaysia advancing towards the digitalisation of finance, there are plenty of reasons to believe that open banking will be a key stepping stone.
