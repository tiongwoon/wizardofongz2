        (read: 'Re-Tweak') stands for Random Thoughts Worth Keeping. It is a
        collection of aphorisms. 'Random' is because it is not bounded by any
        underlying discourse.

          The man who wants to gain wisdom profits greatly from having thought
          for a time that man is basically evil and degenerate: this idea is
          wrong, like its opposite, but for whole periods of time it was
          predominant and its roots have sunk deep into us and into our world.
          To understand ourselves we must understand it; but to climb higher, we
          must then climb over and beyond it. We recognise that there are no
          sins in the metaphysical sense; but, in the same sense, neither are
          there any virtues; we recognise that this entire realm of moral ideas
          is in a continual state of fluctuation, that there are higher and
          deeper concepts of good and evil, moral and immoral. A man who desires
          no more from things than to understand them easily makes peace with
          his soul and will err(or 'sin', as the world calls it) at the most out
          of ignorance, but hardly out of desire. He will no longer want to
          condemn and root out his desire; but his single goal, governing him
          completely, to understand as well as he can at all times, will cool
          him down and soften all the wildness in his disposition. In addition,
          he has rid himself of a number of tormenting ideas; he no longer feels
          anything at the words 'pains of hell', 'sinfulness', 'incapacity for
          the good': for him they are only the evanescent silhouettes of
          erroneous thoughts about life and the world. - Friedrich Nietzsche

          Free-spirited people, living for knowledge alone, will soon find they
          have achieved their external goal in life, their ultimate position vis
          a vis society and the state, and gladly be satisfied, for example,
          with a minor position or a fortune that just meets their needs, for
          they will set themselves up to live in such a way that a great change
          in economic conditions, even a revolution in political structures,
          will not overturn their life with it. They expend as little energy as
          possible on all these things, so that they can plunge with all their
          assembled energy, as if taking a deep breath, into the element of
          knowledge. They can then hope to dive deep, and also get a look at the
          bottom. Such a spirit will be happy to take only the corner of an
          experience, he does not love things in the whole breath and prolixity
          of their folds; for he does not want to get wrapped up in them. -

          By knowing ourselves and regarding our nature itself as a changing
          sphere of opinions and moods, thus learning to despise it a bit, we
          bring ourselves into balance with others again. It is true, we have
          good reason to despise each of our acquaintances, even the greatest;
          but we have just as good reasons to turn this feeling against
          ourselves. - Friedrich Nietzsche

          A theory is like a medicine (or government): often useless, sometimes
          necessary, always self serving, and on occasion lethal. - Nassim Taleb

          Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a
          riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build
          into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your
          affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is
          passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the
          things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of
          the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The
          ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together
          into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that
          has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular
          balance of success or failure is of less account. - John Gardner

          I still think we’re our own jailkeepers, but I’ve concluded that our
          parents and the society at large have a hand in building our prisons.
          They create roles for us — and self-images — that hold us captive for
          a long time. The individual intent on self-renewal will have to deal
          with ghosts of the past — the memory of earlier failures, the remnants
          of childhood dramas and rebellions, accumulated grievances and
          resentments that have long outlived their cause. Sometimes people
          cling to the ghosts with something almost approaching pleasure — but
          the hampering effect on growth is inescapable. - John Gardner

          Everyone I have met was the same. For some it is money, for some it is
          women, drinking, children, family, even worshipping gods, dreams,
          power...Everyone had to be drunk on something to keep pushing on.
          Everyone was a slave to something. Even him who called himself King. -

          Chasing good experience all the time is itself a bad experience,

          To not care about what shitty things people think of you, you also
          need to not care about what shiny things people think of you.

          All of life forms strive to reach their maximum potential, except
          humans. A tree strives to grow as tall as it possibly could, a leopard
          strives to run as fast as it possibly could to catch a prey, but we
          humans can do nothing. This is because humans are granted with the
          misfortune of choice. We can choose not to.
