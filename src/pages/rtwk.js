        (read: 'Re-Tweak') stands for Random Thoughts Worth Keeping. It is a
        collection of aphorisms. 'Random' is because it is not bounded by any
        underlying discourse.

          A theory is like a medicine (or government): often useless, sometimes
          necessary, always self serving, and on occasion lethal. - Nassim Taleb

          What are you going to do? Sometimes life's a bitch and then you die.
          Sometimes life's a bitch and you keep on living. - BoJack and Diane

          But every happy ending has a day after the happy ending, right? And
          the day after that. - Diane Nguyen

          Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a
          riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build
          into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your
          affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is
          passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the
          things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of
          the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The
          ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together
          into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that
          has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular
          balance of success or failure is of less account. - John Gardner

          I still think we’re our own jailkeepers, but I’ve concluded that our
          parents and the society at large have a hand in building our prisons.
          They create roles for us — and self-images — that hold us captive for
          a long time. The individual intent on self-renewal will have to deal
          with ghosts of the past — the memory of earlier failures, the remnants
          of childhood dramas and rebellions, accumulated grievances and
          resentments that have long outlived their cause. Sometimes people
          cling to the ghosts with something almost approaching pleasure — but
          the hampering effect on growth is inescapable. - John Gardner

          Everyone I have met was the same. For some it is money, for some it is
          women, drinking, children, family, even worshipping gods, dreams,
          power...Everyone had to be drunk on something to keep pushing on.
          Everyone was a slave to something. Even him who called himself King. -

          Chasing good experience all the time is itself a bad experience,
          accepting bad experience is itself a good experience. - Mark Manson

          The older you get, the more you need to understand baby steps,
          especially in learning something or in relationship.

          To not care about what shitty things people think of you, you also
          need to not care about what shiny things people think of you.

          All of life forms strive to reach their maximum potential, except
          humans. A tree strives to grow as tall as it possibly could, a leopard
          strives to run as fast as it possibly could to catch a prey, but we
          humans can do nothing. This is because humans are granted with the
          misfortune of choice. We can choose not to.
