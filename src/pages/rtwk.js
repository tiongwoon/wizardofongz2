          Everyone I have met was the same. For some it is money, for some it is
          women, drinking, children, family, even worshipping gods, dreams,
          power...Everyone had to be drunk on something to keep pushing on.
          Everyone was a slave to something. Even him who called himself King. -

          Chasing good experience all the time is itself a bad experience,

          To not care about what shitty things people think of you, you also
          need to not care about what shiny things people think of you.

          All of life forms strive to reach their maximum potential, except
          humans. A tree strives to grow as tall as it possibly could, a leopard
          strives to run as fast as it possibly could to catch a prey, but we
          humans can do nothing. This is because humans are granted with the
          misfortune of choice. We can choose not to.
