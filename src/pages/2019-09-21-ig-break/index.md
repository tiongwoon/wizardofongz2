About 5 years ago, I created my personal Instagram account. A few months ago, upon realising my addiction and how it was starting to negatively impact my mental wellbeing, I decided to disable it for a while. To fill you in some context, I have developed a habit of mindlessly scrolling through my feed, refreshing as soon as I run out of content to consume. On top of that, I realised that the fear of missing out, better known as FOMO, had been slowly but steadily creeping into my mind. Every post about someone traveling, about someone reaching this milestone and so on just added to the pool of anxiety resource where I could visit whenever I needed to feel bad about myself. Another reason, perhaps more practical, was that Instagram has been wasting a lot of my time when I could be doing something productive instead. It was a tipping point when I knew I needed to stop this self-destruct habit. And here are my insights:

 1. Things that I thought I needed to know, I don't actually need to 

    That island that Tom was visiting, that bubble tea that Dick was sipping, and that spaceship that Harry was riding, and the list goes on. I used to live thinking that these moments are unmissable, I mean , come on. You can't be missing out, more so if it's your good friend. It almost feels like I am part of the event when I am viewing it, which fills the emptiness in my life, especially on a mundane weekend. 

    However, here I want to make a distinction if you are feeling the same way-You are not experiencing what is happening there over the screen by viewing it. You are just watching an intricately curated moment. Most of them, I can guarantee you can afford to miss. I repeat. YOU CAN AFFORD TO MISS SOMETIMES. No biggie. Life goes on. There will be another new story tomorrow, another one the day after, you get it. Sure, go ahead and check out some, but understand that you can always afford to miss some.

    Here's a suggestion for an alternative: If you want to know what is going on in your friend's life, text or call. Grab a coffee. Just a quick and short text means much more than a view. At least for me. Those who matter will find a way to be in your life.

1. Hella lot of time saved  

    My Instagram screen time was topping 2 hours (or even more on some days), which was really horrifying. Imagine how many hours a year I had wasted on mindless scrolling. I damn well know the value of time, how it is precious and time wasted we can never get it back. I guess it was a case of my addiction triumphing over my urgency of time.

    After disabling the app, I am getting so much more of my time back. Not going to lie and claim I used them all wisely (I'm still human), but I have more time for other activities that are more enriching.

1. Being more present in life    
    When I used to share IG stories, my thought process was that I share moments which will perhaps shape some form of perception of me. Moments that would make me look 'cool'. The problem here is that these moments failed to portray the entire story. I could have had an awful time and yet no one would know from the snaps (how can you tell from a picture where I am smiling). I started to lose that sense of authenticity.

Thankfully, taking a break from the app did help me regain that sense. I can feel myself enjoying the moment better by being fully present. I will still find myself recording or snapping certain moments, but only for my own remembrance. Don't get me wrong here. I am definitely not against anyone using Instagram whatsoever, these are just some thoughts on its reduced usage. There are always two sides to a coin. I am back on Instagram now, but with a more reliable usage habits. Here I share with you my take on how to use Instagram wisely. I spent some time studying suggestions from other sources in the process of forming my own opinion:

1. Cleanse your feed  
In his Digital Minimalism series (link here), YouTuber Nathaniel Drew suggested that we unfollow people who you barely speak to nowadays, especially if that person is not playing an important role in your life such that you will consider him or her a close friend. In general we tend to just follow someone thinking it will be good to know what is going on in their lives, but it can quickly grow exponentially and soon you will find your news feed cluttered with posts from people who you probably just spoke a few words before. And I can safely say that these have no positive impact on your life. Some examples will be old acquaintances from primary school, someone you met at a party 10 years ago and never speak again, and so on.

    Instead, fill your feed with inspirations. These can be people and influencer who inspired you, photography accounts, or even accounts which are related to your passion or interest. This way, even when you give in to temptation and go on Instagram, you will still be consuming some quality materials. Let Instagram be your inspiration.

1. Increase friction by deleting the app  
    In the book Atomic Habits, author James Clear talked about how increasing friction to carrying out a bad habit can help in reducing it. My attempt to limit the amount of times I go on Instagram is as such- Delete the app on my phone. Yes, delete it. Now, I am only able to go on Instagram on my phone through the web app in the Chrome browser. What is the difference, you may ask. Well, it increases the number of taps I need to be able to reach my home feed. And it removes the chances of a notification pulling me back to the app. I cannot guarantee this will work for you, however, as I am admittedly a very lazy person, so any extra amount of taps means hassle to me. Give it a try, nevertheless?

1. Do something fun but don't post on Instagram. Will you still enjoy it?  
    The ability to broadcast our lives has conditioned our mind to 'perform' for it. The people we hang out with, the clothes we wear, the activities we do, or even how we act, has perhaps been somewhat fabricated in order to create the persona we want to be perceived, even if that is not who we truly are. It is hard for me to accept this fact initially, but as I grow to be more self-aware and look at my own behaviour objectively, I know this has to stop if I were to maintain my authenticity.

    In the Charisma on Command YouTube channel (link here), the host Charlie talked about how Instagram is ruining your life (a better version of what I have here so I highly recommend you checking it out). And one of the tips he gave which I find really interesting is such- Go do something interesting or cool, something you have always wanted to do like skydiving, solo-travelling etc, and refrain from posting anything on Instagram. Then, ask yourself this: Do you still enjoy doing it? Doing this can help you rediscover your true self (gotta be a bit corny here), as you will be able to know if what you are doing still excites you, given that you are not able to broadcast it. For instance, I went skydiving about a year ago, and I did not share any posts nor stories on social media. Rather, it was a story I share with my close circle when I met them after, and often times I watched the video with them while sharing laughter and banter. Much more meaningful this way if you ask me.

    Of course, I am not asking you not to post anything at all (What's the point of Instagram if that is the case). You have free will, just like all of us. This is just something you can try it out to derive introspections. I'll leave it to you to decide what's best for you.

    
*How many likes is your life worth? - The Chainsmokers*

I strongly recommend the 'Nosedive' episode of the Black Mirror series (if you haven't) for a realistic glimpse of how toxic a society can be if we all live on social media instead of reality. By all means, you don't need to eliminate it from your life completely. Participate healthily and stay away from fabricating a persona. It's terrifying to be missing out, to be or not be perceived in a certain way, but in doing so you are missing out on the most important thing-your own real life. Look past what is on a screen. Pictures are worth a thousand words but life is more than just words. It is more about being present and enjoying the moment. Let Instagram (or social media) be the platform for you to express yourself. Take petty judgements solely based on your social media as a pinch of salt. Why be others when you can be you?
