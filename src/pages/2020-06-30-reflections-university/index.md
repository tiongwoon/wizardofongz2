I just graduated from a four-year degree. It was a long and strenuous journey and has its ups and downs. I hope to lay down some of my observations, reflections, and lessons in this post. As I am aware there are a ton of '11 Advices From a Graduate' and 'How To Succeed in University' kind of articles out there, I tried my best to not make this post another one of 'those'.

## How I Met Your Loafer - On Choosing a Group Member  
Throughout my university tenure, I worked in lots of group projects and I gradually picked up an important heuristic when it comes to choosing a group member - the best group member is not the one who has the best grades, it is the one who shares the same outcome expectation as you. 

Think about it, if you are aiming for a score of 65 and you team up with someone who is aiming for 75, they will want to ensure they achieve their goal and their effort will reflect so. But you will be reluctant to put in that extra effort since you believe you have already done enough to achieve the grade that you want, which then will make you look more like the social loafer in the group even though you're not in the wrong. By the way, [social loafing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing) is a phenomenon where a person exerts less effort when working in a group compared to when working alone. 

Just like how it is impossible to win a battle if half the army wants victory and the other wants to surrender, the gap in effort stemming from different aims will likely dampen working relationship and therefore it is counter-productive. On the same note, even if you team up with someone smarter (grade-wise), if you aim to achieve similar grades as him or her, you will naturally up your game and match his or her effort. My best experiences in group projects have been the ones I worked with those aiming the same grades as I did. You might be thinking 'surely everyone should aim for the highest grades'. However, grades are not the only thing that matter and a balance with other interest pursuits makes a more fulfilling experience.

How? You ask. Well, I don't have a textbook answer. Sometimes you are lucky and you just know people like that. Intuition. Sometimes, you might need to make a few conversations. But don't take this as the only 'all or nothing' rule. Definitely stay away from arrogant and snobby show-offs and assholes. And certainly don't swim in the quagmire of academia smugness by becoming one. 

## Being Yourself - On Eff Argh Eye Eee And Thee Ass
Somehow there is this social pressure of making friends when entering university and it is unfortunate yet understandable. Stepping into university as young adults/late teenagers, we are extremely conscious about how others judge us and therefore seek security from being part of a social circle. The [Loners are Freaks](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks) film trope didn't help too, they make us afraid of appearing alone and being perceived as a loser. 

The consequence? One will likely end up with the wrong friends. One's eagerness to impress and make friends results in the wrong metrics being used to select friends. They include popularity, wealth, race, coolness, looks, status, nationality, and a dumpster of other ultra-superficial reasons. These metrics ended up becoming the substitute for one's judgement of human character and values compatibility and soon, intro music starts to play and the drama begins. 

Good news is, eventually, values will be the ultimate jury and dictates the outcome of a friendship. A disparity in values will spell the end and vice versa. This is under the caveat that one doesn't conform and blindly submits to group think. Easier said than done though, but awareness of it goes a long way. 

There is something poetry about the courage to be alone and the refusal to conform to 'because everyone else is like that'. Looking back, those who do so are always respectable. Took me a while to realise that no company is better than bad company. The nature fact that humans are social animals does not mean spending time with people who make you feel exhausted is justifiable or even worthwhile. 

Ironically, the freedom to choose who you spend your time with and the audacity to stand alone will make you a better friend (and lover). 

## Download the Life Template?  
Since young, perhaps due to a combination of the my upbringing, environment, and the films and shows that I consumed, I was made to believe that the end goal is to live my life following what I call the template of life:

Attend university -> graduate -> get a secure job once you graduate -> buy a car and a house (ideally by the age of 28) -> get married (ideally before 30)  -> start a family with some babies -> get your kids to repeat the previous steps 

As university students, we sometimes face huge amount of pressure from society to live out the template, that we are either a template champion or a failure of the universe. There is always the next to-do item in the pipeline. When are you getting a job? When are you getting married? When are you buying a house? 

How bout when are you going to start living a life? 

I realise (with huge relief) that this could not be further from the truth. There is no template. Neither is there a law of nature that says we need to be. 

Think of it this way. Watching a shitty trailer that reveals the entirety of a film's plot or being fed spoilers by some meme will most likely rile us up, as they ruin the enjoyment of watching the actual film and the excitement of seeing the plot unfolds. So why would you put your life in a box and be content at knowing where you will end up in 10 or 20 years time? 

In his book [Antifragility](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Antifragile-Things-that-Gain-Disorder/dp/0141038225), Nassim Taleb called this 'touristification' - the attempt to suck randomness out of life. There is life because there is randomness. Every step of the way presents us with unique circumstances and opportunities that need us to adjust and make decisions. I am not opposing people buying a house or getting married or whatnot, but if you are doing it for the sake of checking off the template list, then it is classic touristification. You might want to rethink your decision.   

After all, will you still enjoy watching a movie if you already know its ending?
