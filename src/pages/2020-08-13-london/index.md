First, you say goodbye to London by remembering that across four years of your stay, never once did you step into the oh-so-famous telephone booth, nor did you take the uber-important, tourists-can't-live-without photo with it. And that somehow jolted a tint of relief.

You say goodbye to London by noticing the prominence of geometrical shapes towering across the skyline. You stand at the peak of Primrose Hill and launch your gaze, and when you stare at the circle, triangle and rectangle panorama, the city stares back at you.

You say goodbye to London by starting to see the overlooked essence of the city: the intricacies of the carvings on the majestic government buildings and the statues that can sometimes dwarf you; hidden chair in the corner of Battersea Park that grants you tranquillity and lets you escape the sometimes monotonous sight of a homo sapien; friendly pigeons that want to make acquaintance but you are kinda smug so no. Then, you keep looking: history; mansions with a fat dog funded by cash with sweet Fairy-Non-Bio-Washing-Liquid scent; Men in suits working unknowingly towards another financial crashâ€¦Oh, shut up, Diogenes!

You say goodbye to London by appreciating the people who crossed your path during your time here and who made it truly amazing. Without them, even London on steroids would suck. People maketh place.

There are different types of goodbyes. Some goodbyes are for those who you absolutely wish never to say hello again. Some goodbyes are really just 'au revoir', or 'see you again'. So to London, see you again.
